Love Calculator ðŸ’–
The Love Calculator is a fun and interactive web application that calculates a "love score" between two names. It's a simple yet enjoyable project to explore basic JavaScript functionalities, HTML structuring, and CSS styling with the help of Bootstrap for responsive design.

Features:
User Input: Two text input fields where users can enter their name and their partner's name.
Calculation Logic: A basic algorithm that calculates a "love percentage" based on the combined character codes of the input names.
Interactive UI: A clean and responsive design using Bootstrap, providing a user-friendly interface.
Result Display: Instant display of the calculated love score with a friendly message.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For basic styling and layout.
Bootstrap 5: For responsive and modern design elements.
JavaScript: For handling the form submission and calculating the love score.
How It Works:
Users enter their name and their partner's name in the provided input fields.
Upon submitting the form, a simple JavaScript function calculates a love score based on the combined character codes of both names.
The result is displayed on the same page with a percentage indicating the "love score."
Installation and Usage:
Clone the repository.
Open the LoveCalculator.html file in any modern web browser.
Enter the names and see the magic!
